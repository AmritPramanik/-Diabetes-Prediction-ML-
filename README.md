# üé¨ Bollywood Celebrity Predictor

A Python-based deep learning application that identifies the closest matching Bollywood celebrity from a given input image with a visible face. This project uses facial recognition and classification techniques to predict the most similar celebrity face from a pre-trained model.

## üîÅ Process Workflow

1. **Load an Image**  
   Upload a picture (can be of yourself or any other face).

2. **Face Detection**  
   Use **MTCNN** (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) to detect and extract faces from the image.

3. **Preprocessing**  
   Resize and normalize the face for input into the neural network.

4. **Model Prediction**  
   Load the face image into a pre-trained **ResNet-50** model.

5. **Output**  
   Display the Bollywood celebrity with the closest resemblance to the input image.
